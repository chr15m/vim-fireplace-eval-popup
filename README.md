This vim plugin hooks into [vim-fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace)'s to display CIDER-style inline evaluation results, in addition to printing results at the bottom of the screen.

```
(inc 0) => 1
```

Install it the normal way you install Vim plugins e.g. check out into `~/.vim/bundle` etc.
